# KD9VVB Logger ADI
Rework of KD9VVB Logger to export as ADI files

This rework functions in a similar way to the original KD9VVB Logger, however this time it utilizes the ADIF format.
There is some basic error checking as well, and support for appending to existing logs has been added.
I will eventually back-port appending to existing files to the original KD9VVB logger as well.
